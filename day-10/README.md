# Media Queries

## Key Points

- mobile first when mobile has style and in media query we define for dektop.

- @media(min-width: 600px) : means 600px or bigger.

- desktop first when desktop has style and in media query we define for mobile.

- @media(max-width: 600px): means 600px or smaller.

- If media type not given it is targeting all media types.

- media query should be defined from smallest to bigger width values so that css can be overide for bigger screen.

how to decide breakpoint: 

    - find it by doing playing with layout.

    - find 1 or 2 breakpoints. 

- Create HTML file looking at desktop design then css with mobile first.
- Why Mobile first ?. As sites are already responsive it is better to start with mobile first otherwise we took its responsivenes.
