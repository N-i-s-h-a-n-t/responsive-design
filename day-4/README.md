# CSS Viewport Units

## Key Points

- One thing with vh is once you go to mobile everything spills.

- we have to fix that with media queries

- vw in font size makes the thing very responsive type which can be super good to titles.

- but we may want to use media queries as it can become very small or big based in screen sizes.

- vh takes viewport height
- vw take viwport width
- vmax take max of vh or vw
- vmin take min of vh or vw
